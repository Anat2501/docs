# Welcome to Kaspa Docs

> This documentation site is a work in progress.

Kaspa is a highly scalable, highly secure, [proof of work](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Proof_of_work) cryptocurrency using [the PHANTOM blockDAG consensus protocol](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/104.pdf). It focuses on providing fast [confirmation times](glossary.md#confirmation-time) and a near-instant [proof of publication](glossary.md#proof-of-publication-aka-data-availability) infrastructure. Kaspa is [premine](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/premining.asp)-less, [deflationary](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Controlled_supply#Deflation), and without explicit central governance.

To help those interested in Kaspa learn about and contribute to the project, the initial team has written and is maintaining this documentation site.

This site aims to be a hub for educational resources, guides, and technical documentation for researchers, developers and users. It contains educational material to help readers learn about the motivation, core concepts, components, and technical details needed to understand Kaspa.

Kaspa and this documentation site are still in development. Kaspa is close to a non-feature-complete [TestNet](glossary.md#testnet). To chat with the team and the community, join the [Kaspa Discord](https://discord.gg/WmGhhzk).
