# Welcome to Kaspa Docs

> This documentation site is a work in progress.

Based on [PHANTOM](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/104.pdf) - a scalable generalization of Nakamoto consensus, we are aiming to build the fastest pure proof of work consensus engine in the crypto space.

Kaspa provides near-instant [proof of publication](glossary.md#proof-of-publication-aka-data-availability) infrastructure and [confirmation times](glossary.md#confirmation-time) within seconds. Kaspa is [premine](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/premining.asp)-less, [deflationary](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Controlled_supply#Deflation), and without explicit central governance.

To help people learn about Kaspa and contribute to the project, the initial team is maintaining this documentation.

Kaspa is still in development and close to a non-feature-complete [TestNet](glossary.md#testnet). For more info, chat with us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/WmGhhzk).
