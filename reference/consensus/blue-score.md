# Blue Score

The blue score of a [block](../blocks/) is the number of [blue blocks](blue-set/#blue-block) in its [past](../blockdag/past.md).

In the Kaspa [blockDAG](../blockdag/), blue score, rather than [block height](../../glossary.md#block-height), is used to convey the "age" of a block since genesis.
