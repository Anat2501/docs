# Red Set

The red set is the set of [blocks](../blocks/) in the [blockDAG](../blockdag/) that PHANTOM/GHOSTDAG output as red. _Intuitively_, it is the set of blocks that were withheld, or mined on an old state \(did not reference all the [tips](../blockdag/tips.md) of the blockDAG at the time they were created\) are likely to turn out red.

### Red Block

A **red block** is a block that is included in the red set.
