# Transaction's Including Blocks

In Kaspa, a transaction may be included in more than one block. A **transaction's including blocks** are all the [blocks](../blocks/) containing that [transaction](./).

Note that Kaspa, [transactions](./) are referenced by their [non-malleable](transaction-malleability.md#Transaction-Non-Malleability) [id](./#Transaction-ID) rather than their [hash](./#Transaction-Hash).
