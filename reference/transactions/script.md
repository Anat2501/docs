# Script

Kaspa uses a scripting system in its transactions almost identical to Bitcoin's. For a gentle introduction to Bitcoin Script, see [this section](https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook/blob/develop/ch06.asciidoc#transaction-scripts-and-script-language) of Mastering Bitcoin Chapter 6. For a more detailed specification of Bitcoin Script, see the [Bitcoin wiki article](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script). Another good walkthrough is available on the [Bitcoin.org developer site](https://developer.bitcoin.org/devguide/transactions.html#introduction).

Transaction scripts describe how outputs can be accessed and allow flexibility in transaction type. A "locking" script "encumbers" the transaction outputs, requiring the "unlocking" script to meet certain criteria before the outputs can be released and spent in a new transaction.

Script uses commands called "opcodes".

### P2PKH

Pay-to-pub-key-hash \(P2PKH\)

### P2SH

Pay-to-script-hash \(P2SH\)

### Multisig <a id="Multisig"></a>

Multi-signature \(multisig\) transactions 

### Changes in Script from Bitcoin

For completeness, the following lists changes in Script from Bitcoin to Kaspa.

1. No multisig dummy: in Bitcoin, the multisig opcode expects an additional input that it doesnâ€™t use. In Kaspa this was removed\)
2. Remove OP\_CODESEPARATOR: in Bitcoin, OP\_CODESEPARATOR is used to make OP\_CHECKSIG check only _part_ of the scriptPubKey. Essentially, only the script that goes after the last OP\_CODESEPARATOR is used to sign the transaction and hence evaluated by OP\_CHECKSIG.
3. Remove FindAndDelete functionality
4. [SigHashSingle](https://godoc.org/github.com/btcsuite/btcd/txscript#SigHashType) errors on wrong index
5. Minimum-if-policy as consensus rule: in Bitcoin, this is only for segwit transactions
6. Applied[ BIP 62](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0062.mediawiki) as consensus rule
7. Changed opcodeCheckLockTimeVerify and opcodeCheckSequenceVerify to use Pop instead of Peek: because these opcodes override NOPs in Bitcoin, they need to peek for the input and then call OP\_DROP manually.

## Standard Transactions

As in Bitcoin, Kaspa has [standard transactions](https://developer.bitcoin.org/devguide/transactions.html#standard-transactions) that pass the IsStandard\(\) test in the Kaspad client. In Kaspad, only P2SH and P2PKH are standard.
