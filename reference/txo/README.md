  This section contains information related to transaction outputs and the UTXO
  model. Below is a description of TXOs.

# Transaction Output \(TXO\)

"TXO" stands for "transaction output". Each [transaction](../transactions/) consumes one or more [inputs](../transactions/#Transaction-Inputs-1) and produces one or more [outputs](../transactions/#Transaction-Outputs). The inputs are references to unspent outputs \([UTXOs](utxo.md)\) of previous transactions. The inputs must be valid \(i.e., exist in the [UTXO set](https://daglabs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SPEC/pages/682328425/UTXO+Set) of the [past](https://daglabs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SPEC/pages/594477229/Past) of the transaction's [block](../blocks/)\).

A UTXO cannot be partially consumed. The sum of all the UTXOs a transaction consumes must be greater or equal to the sum of the new outputs it produces. The remainder, if there is any, constitutes the [fee](../transactions/coinbase-transaction.md) that the transaction creator offers miners for including it in a block.

## Lifecycle <a id="Lifecycle"></a>

A TXO is consumed and produced by transactions. It exists for [accepted transactions](../consensus/accepted-transactions.md). Once it exists, it is first unspent \(UTXO\), until it is spent \([STXO](stxo.md)\) in another transaction. It may become unspent again, during a [reorg](../consensus/reorganization-of-the-blockdag-reorg.md).

## Serialized Format <a id="Serialized-Format"></a>

A serialized transaction output is comprised of the fields of the following table, in the order they appear in the table, and with the types described in the table.â€Œ

Kaspa transaction outputs are the same as [Bitcoin transaction outputs](https://bitcoin.org/en/glossary/output), except that they are uint64 instead of int64.

| **Field Name** | **Type** | **Size in bytes** | **Description** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| value | uint64 | 8 | Amount in Sompis |
| scriptPubKeyLen | [VarInt](https://daglabs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SPEC/pages/144048451/VarInt) | variable | The length of the script pub key |
| scriptPubKey | \[\]byte | scriptPubKeyLen | A script that the redeemer must meet in order to spend the value |
