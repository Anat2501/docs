# Installation

Kaspad is the reference full node Kaspa implementation written in Go.

This project is currently under active development and is in a pre-alpha state. Some things still don't work and APIs are far from finalized. The code is provided for reference only.

Kaspad is currently unsupported by 32bit machines.

There are a few ways to install kaspad full node:

* Building from source:
  * [Linux](build-from-source.md)
  * [Windows](windows.md) 
  * [Mac](mac.md) 
* Get Kaspad by installing [Kasparov API Server Docker](../../kasparov-api-server/installing/docker-quick-start.md): this will install Kasparov API Server and all dependencies, which includes Kaspad.
* KDX: a community created installer and Docker creator \[TBD: link\]
