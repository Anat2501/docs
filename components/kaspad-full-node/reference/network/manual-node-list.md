# Manual Node List

The manual node list is a list of nodes added manually with the [addManualNode RPC call](../../usage/rpc-api/).

Note that nodes added with the `oneTry` flag are not added to the manual node list.

Nodes can be removed from the manual node list with the [removeManualNode RPC call](../../usage/rpc-api/).
