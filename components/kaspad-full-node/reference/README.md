# Reference

For an overview of the code directories in [kaspad](../#working-with-a-full-node), see [the GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/kaspanet/kaspad).

Kaspad full nodes interact with each other in the Kaspa [network](network/) and in Kaspa [subnetworks](subnetworks-1.md). See those pages for more details.
