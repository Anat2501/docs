# Get Started

## Get Informed

Kaspa is based on [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) in code and culture, but the code and consensus protocol have been  modified to accommodate fast and parallelized block creation \(on the order of one block per second\). To understand how Kaspa achieves this and its differences from Bitcoin:

* Look through the [Glossary](../glossary.md), which contains definitions of terms specific to Kaspa, along with links to extensive documentation.
* Read the [PHANTOM and GHOSTDAG](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/104.pdf) paper or [this explanation](../reference/consensus/) of it.
* Read the [BlockDAG](../reference/blockdag/) and [Consensus](../reference/consensus/) sections of this site.

To experience the one-block-per-second blockDAG, visit [DAGviz](https://dagviz.aspectron.com).
