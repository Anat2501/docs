# About Kaspa

Kaspa is an ongoing project that aims to be a [consensus](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consensus-mechanism-cryptocurrency.asp) stack similar to [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) in its base blockchain layer design and similar to [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/whitepaper/) in its capabilities and expressiveness. The high-level mission is to build a decentralized currency that will be attractive for [HODL](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hodl.asp)ers and institutional investors as a [store of value](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/storeofvalue.asp) \(SoV\), and at the same time support open finance applications. One can acquire Kaspa by mining it; there is no [premine](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/premining.asp).

The current crypto space offers either SoV-only cryptocurrencies \(e.g., Bitcoin, Litecoin, Zcash, Monero, Grin\) that do not support financial applications; or [smart contract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract) platforms that operate with [proof of stake consensus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_stake), compromising the [sound money](https://mises.org/library/principle-sound-money) property of their respective native tokens, and that are therefore not adopted as SoV vehicles.

Accordingly, [the base layer of Kaspa](../glossary.md#layer-1) is optimized for security and speed, based on [PHANTOM](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/104.pdf), a scalable generalization of the "Nakamoto Consensus" of Bitcoin. PHANTOM allows for fast [confirmation times](../glossary.md#confirmation-time) and throughput on the order of one block per second without compromising security or reverting to centralization. [The second layer](../glossary.md#layer-2) is optimized for expressiveness and usability, and supports [EVM](https://eth.wiki/en/concepts/evm/ethereum-virtual-machine-%28evm%29-awesome-list) and other virtual machines via [optimistic rollup](../glossary.md#optimistic-rollup) constructions. This layer is decoupled from the money base layer, keeping it as thin and secure as possible.

For a more in-depth but still high-level description of Kaspa aimed at those familiar with Bitcoin and general crypto concepts, see [Kaspa for Bitcoiners](kaspa-for-bitcoiners.md).
